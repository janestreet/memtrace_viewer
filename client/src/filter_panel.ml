     especially important because otherwise adding a new clause would cause the displayed
     filter (e.g., the ranges in the graph) to disappear.

     (We could instead use a component that remembers the last valid filter, but that's
     rather involved. We would want something (more or less) of type

     [is_valid:('a -> bool) -> 'a Bonsai.Value.t -> 'a Bonsai.Computation.t]

     last known valid input as a side effect. It could instead be in the style of a
     state machine:

     [is_valid:('a -> bool) -> ('a * ('a -> unit Vdom.Effect.t)) Bonsai.Computation.t]

     but now, to fire that event, all the components in the filter editor would have to
     support an on_changed event, which is a much more painful workaround than just
     having this [to_filter_allow_incomplete] function.) *)
